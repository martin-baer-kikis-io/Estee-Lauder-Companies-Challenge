# Estee-Lauder-Companies-Challenge

This project is a simple Perl script that prints out the Food trucks selling Tacos in San Francisco.  Data is pulled from a public data source provided by the city.

Not much to the script, just an exercise in Perl programming, but it was fun to do.  Another plus: I finally got to use my favorite 50's TV ad slogan, "LSMFT".  In my opinion, one of the most abstract examples of subliminal advertising from that 'era'. In this context ofcourse, it means: "list Mexican food trucks".



    USAGE:   ./lsmft.pl
