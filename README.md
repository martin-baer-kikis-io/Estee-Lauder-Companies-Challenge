# Estee-Lauder-Companies-Challenge

This project is a simple Perl script that prints out the Food trucks selling Tacos in San Francisco.  Data is pulled from a public data source provided by the city.

Not much to the script, just an exercise in Perl programming, but it was fun to do.  Another plus: I finally got to use my favorite 50's TV ad slogan, "LSMFT".  In my opinion, one of the more abstract examples of subliminal advertising from the era.



    USAGE:   ./lsmft.pl
